            <p>What's the #1 rule about making clothes?</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Design everything to last. That means investing in quality fabrics and workmanship - but it also means designing with simplicity and function in mind.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">We put sustainable thinking at the center of everything - that means we only choose fabrics that care for our environment and we only ever partner with factories that care about their impact, too. 
                When we say sustainability is our core mission we don’t mean that sustainability is nice to have - we mean that it’s the only way we act.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">We only work with trusted, certified factory partners - these are the good guys. They have the same sustainable vision as us - and follow it through by continuously reducing their environmental footprint. </p>
